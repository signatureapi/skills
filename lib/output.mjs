 * malformed key, a key with neither prefix) IS live for the API's purposes.
 * A blocklist that only refused `key_live_...` would pass a key with
 * neither prefix straight through, and check-setup.mjs / resolveKey below
 * would then report that same key's mode as "live" — a gate and a mode
 * report that disagree about the same key. Refusing unless the prefix is
 * exactly the one this tooling is allowed to touch keeps the two in
 * agreement by construction.
